New Status Screen

Columns

Each column is chosen by the user from a list of available column types.
The height of the header control can be set as well as the width and the
text.

The font can be changed as well. One font is used for both the header
control and the rows.

The column type is just a number. 0 = cycle start, 1 = machine name,
etc. Numbers beginning with 100 are parameters from the most recent
shot.

Rows

Each row shows the values for one die cast machine. All machines will be
displayed (? Runlist, my own list?)

The following are events that will update the row.
    1. Monitor change. I will check to see if the part name has changed.
    2. New shot
    3. Downtime status change
    4. 1 minute timer. If I am displaying downtime minutes I will update
       them every minute.

Parameter values will display in red if they are in alarm.

Downtime
total minutes = now - start_of_shift
total up      = sum of times from start_of_shift until now

SYSTEMTIME & start_of_shift( const SYSTEMTIME & now );
unsigned long downtime_seconds(                        const SYSTEMTIME & start_time, CONST SYSTEMTIME & end_time );
